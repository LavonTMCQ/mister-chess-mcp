Recommendation
Based on your current situation, I recommend the following approach:

Short-term Plan (Next 1-2 weeks):
Deploy to Railway + Vercel immediately
You already have accounts
The platform is functional and ready for basic deployment
This will allow agents to connect from anywhere
Setup should take only a few hours
Implementation steps:
Deploy MCP server to Railway:
Connect your GitHub repository
Set build command: npm run build
Set start command: npm run mcp-simple
Set environment variables: PORT=3001, NODE_ENV=production
Deploy Web UI to Vercel:
Connect your GitHub repository
Set build command: npm run build
Set output directory:  dist
Set environment variable: MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app
Set up a custom domain (optional but recommended)
Makes your platform look more professional
Easier for users to remember
Can be configured in both Railway and Vercel
Medium-term Plan (Next 2-4 weeks):
Continue building critical features in parallel
Implement user authentication for agent creators
Add persistent storage (database) for games
Improve error handling and monitoring
Add analytics to track platform usage
Set up CI/CD pipeline
Automated testing before deployment
Staging environment for testing new features
Production environment for stable releases
Why this approach works best:
Get real users and feedback early
Having a live platform will attract users and agents
Real-world usage will reveal issues you haven't considered
User feedback will help prioritize future features
Iterative improvement
Deploy updates incrementally as features are completed
Both Railway and Vercel support automatic deployments from GitHub
You can work on features while the platform is live
Cost-effective
Start with free tiers while usage is low
Scale up only when necessary
Monitor usage to predict when paid plans will be needed
Cost Considerations
Initial deployment: Free tiers on both Railway and Vercel
Low to moderate usage: $5-10/month for Railway (if exceeding free tier)
Higher usage: $20-50/month for both services combined
Technical Considerations for Hosting
Environment Variables
Ensure all configuration is done via environment variables
Store sensitive information securely
CORS Configuration
Configure CORS to allow connections from external agents
Ensure the web UI can communicate with the MCP server
Monitoring and Logging
Set up basic monitoring to track errors and performance
Implement logging to debug issues in production
Database Considerations
Currently using in-memory storage, which is lost on restart
Consider adding MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or another database for persistence
Conclusion and Next Steps
I recommend deploying your Chess MCP Platform to Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) right away, while continuing to develop new features in parallel. This approach gives you the best of both worlds:

A live platform that agents can connect to from anywhere
The ability to continue improving the platform based on real usage
Immediate next steps:

Prepare your codebase for deployment:
Ensure environment variables are properly configured
Test the application locally with production settings
Deploy to Railway and Vercel using the steps outlined above
Test the deployed application:
Connect test agents to verify functionality
Check the web UI works correctly
Share the platform with potential users and collect feedback
This approach allows you to get your platform in front of users quickly while still having the flexibility to improve it over time. The sooner you deploy, the sooner you'll get valuable feedback that will help shape the future of your platform.
